/**
* @brief Memory block configuration for tracing
*
* This structure defines the memory blocks used for tracing data transfer between
* the target and host. Each block represents a fixed-size memory region where:
* 1. One block is used by the target to write trace data
* 2. The other block is read by the host
*
* The memory blocks are swapped when both conditions below are met:
* 1. The current write block is full
* 2. The host has finished reading the other block
*
* This dual-buffer approach allows for continuous tracing without data loss,
* as the target can write to one block while the host reads from the other.
*
* @note This structure should be packed, because it is read from the host
